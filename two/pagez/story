C44 (Chess 4 four) is the story of 1 developer and a great community.

It all began in the week of the 10th of February 2020,

that week Brecht, Johan, Tom and Sven played the first test version of the game.

On X the 4 first testers played the first game with the developer as bystander.

After that game, the game went officially in public Beta.

Soon, thanks to the power of Facebook, quite some players joined and the community began.
