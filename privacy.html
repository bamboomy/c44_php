<h1>Privacy</h1>

Dear player,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely value your privacy.<br/>
<br/>
In this modern world information is the new money.<br/>
<br/>
The more information a site/company has about you,<br/>
<br/>
the more they can earn from you...<br/>
<br/>
We don't play that game...<br/>
<br/>
We just want to make a site where you can have fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, you can spent a dime,<br/>
(the servers aint free)<br/>
<br/>
but money is not the reason we do this...<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Low identity footprint</h2>

At this site we aim for a "Low identity footprint"...<br/>
<br/>
We use as little personal information as possible<br/>
to give everyone a maximum (private) experience...<br/>
<br/>
How do we do this?<br/>
