<h1>Privacy</h1>

Dear player,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely value your privacy.<br/>
<br/>
In this modern world information is the new money.<br/>
<br/>
The more information a site/company has about you,<br/>
<br/>
the more they can earn from you...<br/>
<br/>
We don't play that game...<br/>
<br/>
We just want to make a site where you can have fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, you can spent a dime,<br/>
(the servers aint free)<br/>
<br/>
but money is not the reason we do this...<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Low identity footprint</h2>

At this site we aim for a "Low identity footprint"...<br/>
<br/>
We use as little personal information as possible<br/>
to give everyone a maximum (private) experience...<br/>
<br/>
How do we do this?<br/>
<ul>
	<li>It's possible to use our site without us having your mail address (stored).</li>
	<li>We don't store any financial information.</li>
</ul>

You can (only) log in with a Facebook and/or Google account.<br/>
<br/>
(Authentication has gotten extremely difficult to maintain<br/>
and keep secure nowadays;<br/>
And I like the programming effort to go on the game and features 
in stead of trying to defend our site from hackers...<br/>
<br/>
Security, because of it's nature, is a game you never can totally win.<br/>
<br/>
Our approach is not giving the hackers a reason to break into our systems...<br/>
<br/>
We only store the username you choose when registering,<br/>
<br/>
and a number (id) of Google/Facebook with which we can check whether it's you.<br/>
<br/>
This pretty much means that if your Google/Facebook account get's hacked,<br/>
<br/>
your account on this site is hacked as well,<br/>
<br/>
but if this would happen this site is probably your smalles woe...<br/>
<br/>
<u>It's not possible to hack your Facebook/Google account from within this site!!!</u><br/>
<br/>
