<h1>Privacy</h1>

Dear player,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely value your privacy.<br/>
<br/>
In this modern world information is the new money.<br/>
<br/>
The more information a site/company has about you,<br/>
<br/>
the more they can earn from you...<br/>
<br/>
We don't play that game...<br/>
<br/>
We just want to make a site where you can have fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, you can spent a dime,<br/>
(the servers aint free)<br/>
but money is not the reason we do this...<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Low identity footprint</h2>

At this site we aim for a "Low identity footprint"...<br/>
<br/>
We use as little personal information as possible<br/>
to give everyone a maximum (private) experience...<br/>
<br/>
How do we do this?<br/>
<br/>
In short:
<ul>
	<li>It's possible to use our site without us having your mail address (stored).</li>
	<li>We don't store any financial information.</li>
	<li>We only keep personal information for as long as neccesary.</li>
</ul>

In long:<br/>
<br/>
You can (only) log in with a Facebook and/or Google account.<br/>
<br/>
(Authentication has gotten extremely difficult to maintain<br/>
and keep secure nowadays;<br/>
And I like the programming effort to go on the game and features<br/>
in stead of trying to defend our site from hackers...)<br/>
<br/>
Security, because of it's nature, is a game you can never totally win.<br/>
<br/>
Our approach is not giving the hackers a reason to break into our systems...<br/>
<br/>
We only store the username you choose when registering,<br/>
and a number (id) of Google/Facebook with which we can check whether it's you.<br/>
<br/>
This pretty much means that if your Google/Facebook account get's hacked,<br/>
your account on this site is hacked as well,<br/>
but if this would happen this site is probably your smalles woe...<br/>
<br/>
<u>It's not possible to hack your Facebook/Google account from within this site!!!</u><br/>
<br/>
We rely on Google/Facebook to do what they are extremely good at:<br/>
<br/>
keeping your account secure...<br/>
<br/>
We just make a little game you can enjoy :-)<br/>
<br/>
The only personal information we store (your mail address (only with your consent))<br/>
(or from your friends);<br/>
<br/>
is only stored as long as we need it, an example:<br/>
<br/>
If you create a game and invite friends (via e-mail);<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
	<li>We sent out the invites.</li>
	<li>We only keep the adresses until 1 day/hour before the event (when we send the reminders).</li>
	<li>Right after sending the reminder, the address gets completely deleted from our database.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>At any given time only the addresses we still need for reminders are stored at our side.</li>
	<li>When we delete the information it's gone for good (it's not kept in auditing tables).</li>
	<li>You are not obliged to send out reminders (if you choose not to the event can still be made/played(and no addresses are stored)).</li>
	<li>So we don't need addresses for the site to work...<br/>(It's even possible to send out an invitation link yourself without us having any address)</li>
</ol>
