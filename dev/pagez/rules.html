		<h1>The rules of chess4four</h1>
		
Ok,<br/><br/>

in this game we will play chess with 4 players,<br/>
at the same time,<br/>
on the same board :)<br/><br/>

<h2>The Board:</h2>

This is the board:<br/><br/>

<img src="../imgz/board.png"/><br/><br/>

A few notes compared to other forms of chess with 4 players:<br/>
- it's regular chess, so no promotion in the middle of the board<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(you can promote if you reach the opposite side however<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(which is highly unlikely, but it is implemented)).<br/>
- another difference with other forms of chess with 4 players is: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no "buffer row" in front of your army:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the right and left pawn can take the left and right (respectively) pawn <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the right and left opponent (also respectively)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(and thus freeing the towers early in the game)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(the towers do have a row of eager pawns to look out for <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can be used earlier in the game compared to regular chess).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Castling</h2>

Castling is also supported with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling" target=”_blank”>rule from wikipedia</a><br/>
(i.e. you are allowed to have been check and still castle).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Direction</h2>

The players each play forward, so, for the pawns<br/>
(the only pieces that have a sense of direction<br/>
when it comes to legal moves)<br/>
this means:<br/>
- situation A: both pawns block each other<br/>
- situation B: green is blocked but blue can move ahead<br/>
<br/>

<h2>En passant</h2>

Here I'm quite proud of (pardon my braggin').<br/>
This is where a lot of (some nightly) hours of work showed off:<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant" target=”_blank”>en passant</a>:<br/>
having 4 directions makes the en passant move (which isn't your vanilla chess move)<br/>
<u>3 times</u> as difficult:<br/>
- two (opposing) pawns can possibly perform en passant on the same pawn (fig. C.)<br/>
<img src="../imgz/c.png"/><br/>
- in rare conditions (sometimes it's a burden to be a perfectionist)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one single pawn can capture <u>two</u> different pawns of two different opponents<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>with one and the same en passant move!!!</u> (fig. D.)<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Promoting</h2>

Promoting is possible if you reach the other side of the board<br/>
(the opposite side, so red when it arrives at the green side,<br/>
green at the red side, yellow at the blue side, ...)<br/>
For sake of simplicity you can only promote to a queen or knight.<br/>
A queen can do the same moves as a tower or bishop<br/>
so we didn't see the point in providing this nuance...<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Dubious player</h2>

If there is only the three of you you can still play.<br/>
<br/>
In fact you can also play with two (against two robots)<br/>
(and you can play alone from the start screen against 3 bots<br/>
(but that isn't much fun (the bots are quite weak))).<br/>
<br/>
With three you can opt for a robot player,or a so-called "dubious player":<br/>
the dubious player is controlled by a different player each turn<br/>
if you lose (by mate or pat (or resign))<br/>
you can still choose to control Dubious when it's your turn to do so.<br/>
For now, when 1 human player and only Dubious remain in a game Dubious resigns<br/>
(see also survey).<br/>
You cannot resign from Dubious or let Dubious resign<br/>
(unless you resign from the game)<br/>
(if you resign from the game you can choose whether you still want to control Dubious,<br/>
if you choose to continue controlling Dubious<br/>
you can (for now) not come back from this decision.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Some thoughts</h2>

For players unfamiliar with playing with 4 players this is a real brain teaser.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much information and things you overlook when playing with 4.<br/>
And with three (and Dubious) you see a different viewpoint from time to time<br/>
(which also doesn't help...).<br/>
<br/>
If you have 4 medium level players things can get really complicated real quick.<br/><br/>

For example: if you are strong with the bishops imagine what you can do in this game:<br/><br/>

normally people expect attacks from the back or front (of 1 opponent)<br/>
disorientated about having a left and right opponent a bishop can strike<br/>
from 2x more directions, hidden in the chaos of the board,<br/>
sniping when the opponent least expects it...  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope you will enjoy the game,<br/><br/>

thanks for checking it out (pun intended)<br/><br/>

and it would really be nice if you could take the time to fill in the survey<br/><br/>

most importantly: keep having fun!!!<br/><br/>
